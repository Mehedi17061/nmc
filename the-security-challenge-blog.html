   <p>In a recent survey, we asked security managers and architects 
across multiple industries to rank trends that they believed would be 
most impactful this year. (For more on this survey, including the 
methodology,  see our white paper.) These four trends led the way: 
Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML); the European Union’s 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); the increasing adoption of 
DevSecOps and the process of integrating security into the software 
development lifecycle before an app reaches the traditional testing 
stage; and the growing movement to use software as a service (SaaS) to 
meet security needs.</p>
  <p>Here we’ll examine survey respondents’ plans in each of these four 
areas. We’ll also combine our research with that of other industry 
leaders to provide recommendations.<br>
  </p>
  <h4 class="inner-head-2 b-p5">Artificial intelligence</h4>
  <p>Six out of 10 respondents called AI a top trend in 2019, with plans
 focusing about equally on security analytics; security incident and 
event management; and endpoint protection. Over 50% of those citing AI 
as a top trend planned to purchase more of this technology in 2019, with
 implementation split between internal development and buying from a 
vendor.</p>
  <p>AI/ML is emerging as a useful tool as networks and threats grow 
increasingly complex. Sophisticated attackers can now exploit new 
vulnerabilities in a matter of minutes. Moreover, enterprises report a 
shortage of staff skilled in the myriad tools used to respond to as many
 as 10,000 alerts a day. With studies indicating that analysts can only 
investigate five to 10 issues per day, AI is an absolute necessity.<br>
  </p>
  <p>All this has resulted in a tendency to view AI as a magic bullet. 
While pragmatic AI applications such as anomalous user-behavior 
monitoring and spam/phishing detection are becoming commonplace, keep in
 mind that the arms race never ends — we know from experience that the 
bad guys will simply adapt their attacks. While it’s worthwhile, even 
necessary, to use AI to crunch through massive data sets, merely 
investing in the technology won’t be enough in the long run.<br>
  </p>
  <h4 class="inner-head-2 b-p5">Recommendations</h4>
  <p class="font20">To get the most from AI, security managers must:</p>
  <ul class="l-p0 list-pn list-li5 t-m5n">
    <li>Navigate vendor claims about whether and how AI improves security.</li>
    <li>Integrate newer AI tools with existing security databases and analytic platforms.</li>
    <li>Arm staff with the skills to use AI (or partner with firms that have such skills).</li>
    <li>Recognize and minimize the threat that hackers will use AI to strengthen attacks or to subvert AI security systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="inner-head-2 b-p5">GDPR compliance</h4>
  <p>The European Union’s (EU) GDPR covers more than 500 million 
citizens in 28 countries. Devising and executing a compliance plan is a 
significant challenge, as shown by the fact that 72% of respondents’ 
organizations are affected by GDPR, and 40% listed it as a top trend for
 2019.</p>
  <p>In our study, implementing business processes for complying with 
subject access or deletion requests, as well as reviewing and enforcing 
privacy requirements in third-party contracts, were cited as the most 
difficult parts of GDPR implementation. Surprisingly, implementing 
technical measures to achieve compliance was seen as the most 
straightforward facet; only 6% said they’ve acquired a specific software
 tool for managing GDPR compliance.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Many companies have taken a wait-and-see attitude, hoping to 
benefit from the experience of others and assuming it will take time 
before EU regulators begin fining laggards. This stems from lack of 
executive buy-in, as well as the natural tendency to procrastinate and 
lay responsibility for noncompliance at the doorstep of others.<br>
  </p>
  <p>While businesses in the financial services and healthcare 
industries are familiar with managing regulatory compliance, those in 
other industries have struggled to meet compliance goals, often relying 
on the thriving consultancy business that has sprung up around GDPR.<br>
  </p>
  <h4 class="inner-head-2 b-p5">Recommendations</h4>
  <p class="font20">Organizations doing business with EU citizens should:</p>
  <ul class="l-p0 list-pn list-li5 t-m5n">
    <li>Fully understand why their businesses collect personal data on 
citizens; make sure they’re obtaining opt-in permission for collecting 
and using this data; and explain clearly what it’s used for.</li>
    <li>Ensure they have undertaken data protection impact assessments 
on any high-risk data collected, and report any breaches to relevant 
authorities within 72 hours.</li>
    <li>Embed full lifecycle security by design, to safeguard the private data of citizens if it is collected.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="inner-head-2 b-p5">DevSecOps</h4>
  <p>Developers care greatly about security but are under pressure to 
speed new software to market. DevOps and 
continuous-integration/continuous-delivery models may require code 
releases multiple times per week — or even per day. And even when 
developers attempt to work with security professionals, they don’t speak
 the same language. Security staff focus on the traditional, 
collaborative approach of managing code through audit and review, 
whereas the DevOps paradigm includes the management of infrastructure as
 code.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These are the problems that DevSecOps, which embeds security 
throughout the software development, deployment and operations process, 
seeks to address. It’s no surprise that 49% of respondents listed 
DevSecOps as a top trend, for which they reported mixed success. On the 
plus side, they said they were performing some important DevSecOps 
practices (such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing before
 deployment, as well as periodic infrastructure scans and static code 
analysis), in about half their use cases. However, the use of 
configuration or control rules to restrict capabilities were not 
commonplace.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Relatively low adoption levels for DevSecOps practices show that 
while organizations are trying to embed security in the development 
process, the security function is still not trusted enough to get out of
 the way of the business in a pinch. Adopting DevSecOps requires changes
 in both testing methodologies and culture.<br>
  </p>
  <h4 class="inner-head-2 b-p5">Recommendations</h4>
  <p class="font20">Maximizing the agility and security benefits of DevSecOps requires:</p>
  <ul class="l-p0 list-pn list-li5 t-m5n">
    <li>Changes to testing processes, to reflect trends such as the increased immutability of software subcomponents.</li>
    <li>Changes to culture, such as more open communication between 
security and development teams and empowering developers to take 
responsibility for testing their own code.</li>
    <li>The appropriate use of automation to speed processes, especially as they scale.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="inner-head-2 b-p5">SaaS</h4>
  <p>Cloud-based infrastructure and services often allow organizations 
to adopt, deploy and scale new capabilities more quickly, 
cost-effectively, and flexibly than in-house deployments. In our survey,
 43% of respondents listed SaaS as a top trend. Two-thirds of 
respondents are using cloud applications for some aspect of their 
security, with almost as many (64%) planning to expand such use this 
year.</p>
  <p>What we find troubling is that 54% of respondents are concerned 
about the dependability of SaaS platforms. Such concerns are warranted, 
because the data collected by security applications is often among the 
most sensitive in the organization. Compromised SaaS could even be used 
to distribute malware to some of the organization’s most sensitive 
users: the security department itself. With more attackers infiltrating 
enterprises by masquerading as privileged users, the leakage of 
credentials belonging to security staffers could result in a difficult 
clean-up and could lead to deeper access to highly sensitive 
information. </p>
  <h4 class="inner-head-2 b-p5">Recommendations</h4>
  <p class="font20">Some essential precautions around SaaS:</p>
  <ul class="l-p0 list-pn list-li5 t-m5n">
    <li>Store encryption keys for data in the cloud separately from the 
data they protect, so the keys are not under the control of the SaaS 
provider.</li>
    <li>Because many SaaS platforms do not rigorously support user 
identity management, consider implementing cloud-based identity and 
access management.</li>
    <li>Consider implementing a high-fidelity cloud access security 
broker with data loss protection functionality, which integrates with 
cloud applications to prevent data leakage and keep applications free of
 malware.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>While GDPR (and similar mandates) and SaaS may compel organizations
 to rethink IT security, it’s encouraging that AI/ML and DevSecOps are 
top of mind in so many organizations. The cat-and-mouse nature of the 
security challenge will never change, but there are compelling new tools
 and strategies available.</p>
